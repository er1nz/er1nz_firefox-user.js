# er1nz_firefox-user.js
Comprehensive configuration file for Firefox and Zen-based browsers, meticulously crafted to enhance privacy, security, and performance.

Serves as a personal collection of tweaks and settings, combining the best practices from popular hardening projects like Betterfox and Arkenfox, along with custom user overrides.
Tested on a Windows PC, Zen Browser.

Key Features:
Performance Boost (Fastfox): Optimizes network settings, adjusts cache parameters, and disables speculative loading to provide a faster, more responsive browsing experience.
Enhanced Security (Securefox): Aggressively disables telemetry, crash reporting, and data collection. It hardens browser security by disabling the built-in password and form managers, enforcing strict certificate pinning, and blocking remote Safe Browsing checks to minimize data leaks.
Privacy Focused: Implements strict tracking protection, disables Firefox Sync and Pocket integration, and blocks access to sensitive permissions like geolocation, camera, and notifications by default.
Decluttered UI (Peskyfox & Customizations): Cleans up the user interface by removing sponsored content, disabling intrusive recommendations, hiding unnecessary UI elements like the bookmark bar, and streamlining the new tab page. It also includes quality-of-life improvements like text-only zoom and disabling annoying popups.
User Control: Provides a solid foundation for users to build upon. The file is well-documented, with clear sections for different configurations, making it easy to customize and add personal overrides.
This user.js is ideal for users who want to take full control of their browser, prioritizing a secure, private, and efficient web experience over default features.
